# Basic Usage Examples

This document shows how to run the basic 'hello' command from the CLI application.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python installed.
- Install the required dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Running the 'hello' command

To greet someone, navigate to the `src` directory and run the `main.py` script with the 'hello' command followed by a name:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project/src  # Or ensure src is in your PYTHONPATH
python main.py hello YourName
```

Expected output:
```
Hello, YourName!
```

You can also make the script executable and run it directly if you add a shebang line (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/env python`) to `src/main.py` and give it execute permissions (`chmod +x src/main.py`). Then you could run:

```bash
./src/main.py hello YourName
```
